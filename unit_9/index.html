		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>ACaring about age is for the fickle minded. Or so I thought.</p>
 
			<p>I experienced a little anxiety when before turning 30; mainly because everyone I knew pointed out the significance of that number.</p>
 
			Now, a decade later the same panic is ever present at the back of my mind every single day</p>

			<p>I'm not ready because...okay here goes. It's a weight thing. I've put on a stone and then some. I have never been overweight in my life and I refuse to go enter middle age as unhealthy.</p>

		<h2> Weekly Plan</h2> 
		<p> Week 1. 26/08/2016.</p>

		<P>I don't have a plan a perfect plan. I'm not crazy. I don't expect to become so different in the next 2 months and I don't want to despite what I've said before. However I'm superficial enough to at least try and fix my body as a start</p>
		
		<p>First, get in shape and eat well.</p>

		<p>Since I don't have the discipline myself; I've cheated slight and found a trainer who doesn't think I'm a complete lost cause. A PT who will be really good at kicking my ass. </p>
